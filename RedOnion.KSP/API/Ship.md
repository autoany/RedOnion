## Ship

Active vessel

- `Autopilot`: Autopilot - Autopilot of this ship (vehicle/wessel).
- `Throttle`: Single - Current throttle (assign redirects to `Autopilot`, reads control state if autopilot disabled)
- `Native`: Vessel - Native `Vessel` for unrestricted access to KSP API. Same as `FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel` if accessed through global `ship`.
- `Parts`: [ShipPartSet](../Parts/ShipPartSet.md) - All parts of this ship/vessel/vehicle.
- `Root`: [Part](../Parts/PartBase.md) - Root part (same as `Parts.Root`).
- `NextDecoupler`: [Decoupler](../Parts/Decoupler.md) - One of the decouplers that will get activated by nearest stage. (Same as `Parts.NextDecoupler`.)
- `NextDecouplerStage`: Int32 - Stage number of the nearest decoupler or -1. (Same as `Parts.NextDecouplerStage`.)
- `Decouplers`: ReadOnlyList`1 - List of all decouplers, separators, launch clamps and docks with staging. (Docking ports without staging enabled not included.)
- `DockingPorts`: ReadOnlyList`1 - List of all docking ports (regardless of staging).
- `Engines`: [EngineSet](../Parts/EngineSet.md) - All engines (regardless of state).
- `Sensors`: ReadOnlyList`1 - All sensors.
- `ID`: Guid - Unique identifier of the ship (wehicle/vessel). Can change when docking/undocking.
- `PersistentID`: UInt32 - Unique identifier of the ship (wehicle/vessel). Should be same as it was before docking (after undocking).
- `VesselType`: VesselType - KSP API. Vessel type as selected by user (or automatically).
- `Mass`: Single - Total mass of the ship (wehicle/vessel).
- `Packed`: Boolean - Wheter the ship is still packed (reduced physics).
- `Landed`: Boolean - Wheter the ship is landed (on the ground or on/in water).
- `Splashed`: Boolean - Wheter the ship is in water.
- `Longitude`: Double - Longitude of current position in degrees.
- `Latitude`: Double - Latitude of current position in degrees.
- `Altitude`: Double - Altitude of current position (above sea level) in meters.
- `RadarAltitude`: Double - True height above ground in meters.
- `Orbit`: Orbit - KSP API. Orbit parameters.
- `Body`: CelestialBody - KSP API. Orbited body.
- `Eccentricity`: Double - Eccentricity of current orbit.
- `SemiMajorAxis`: Double - Semi-major axis of current orbit.
- `SemiMinorAxis`: Double - Semi-minor axis of current orbit.
- `Apoapsis`: Double - Height above ground of highest point of current orbit).
- `Periapsis`: Double - Height above ground of lowest point of current orbit).
- `Apocenter`: Double - Highest distance between center of orbited body and any point of current orbit.
- `Pericenter`: Double - Lowest distance between center of orbited body and any point of current orbit.
- `TimeToAp`: Double - Eta to apoapsis in seconds.
- `TimeToPe`: Double - Eta to periapsis in seconds.
- `Period`: Double - Period of current orbit in seconds.
- `TrueAnomaly`: Double - Angle in degrees between the direction of periapsis and the current position.
- `MeanAnomaly`: Double - Angle in degrees between the direction of periapsis and the current position extrapolated on circular orbit.
- `Position`: Vector3d - Current position.
- `Velocity`: Vector3d - Current velocity.
