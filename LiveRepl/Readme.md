**LiveRepl** is the main user interface for the project. It is used to write, load, and evaluate scripts that interact with KSP.

**LiveRepl** is shown or hidden by clicking the LiveRepl Icon: ![LiveRepl Icon](../GameData/RedOnion/Resources/LiveRepl.png)

It consists of:
- An **Editor** for saving, loading, writing, and executing whole files.
- A **Repl Input Area** for executing little snippets of code (for example, for setting or evaluating global variables).
- An **Output Area** for displaying the results of executing files in the editor or snippets of code in the repl input area.
- A **Font Selector** which shows the current font used in the previous 3 parts. The Font Selector can be clicked to select a new font.
- A **Script Filename Selector** which can be clicked to select a new script to load from a list in the scripts directory. Or one can type a new name for a script and click the `Save` button to create a new file with that name.
- A **Completion Area** which shows intellisense results for code when the editor or repl input area is selected, a list of fonts to select from when the Font Selector is selected, or a list of files when the filename selector is selected.
- A bunch of buttons to perform various actions.
