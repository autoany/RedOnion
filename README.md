# RedOnion and Kerbalua

A joint effort of Evan Dickinson and Lukáš Fireš to create
unrestricted scripted environment inside Kerbal Space Program
for all players and even modders wishing to control the game,
vessels, anything, with own script.

**Warning: Do not use scripts from untrusted sources!**
This is not a sandbox, any script has the power to do almost anything.
We plan to eventually implement a switch to limit the power
(disable what is marked `[Unsafe]` in the code),
but our goal now is to:

- Allow users to do whatever they wish to do to the game environment to have fun.
- Help modders develop and debug their mods using this mod.
- Help anybody to explore KSP API, their own or other's mods
  (read the license of each mod, we expose only `public` members directly).
