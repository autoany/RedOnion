# RedOnion and Kerbalua

A joined effort of Evan Dickinson and Lukáš Fireš to create
unrestricted scripted environment inside Kerbal Space Program
for all players and even modders wishing to control the game,
vessels, anything, with own script.

## Differences between ROS and LUA

[**LUA**](https://www.lua.org/)
[(MoonSharp)](https://github.com/xanathar/moonsharp)
is well known scripting language
and will offer more comfort and safety, while
[**ROS** (Red Onion Script)](RedOnion.Script/README.md)
aims to provide unrestricted (and potentionally dangerous)
access to every public method of KSP and Unity.

**ROS** was created anew and may contain bugs,
**LUA** may have some limitations
but should be much safer to use.
