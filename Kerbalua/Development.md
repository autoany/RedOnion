The **Kerbalua** project is implemented using [MoonSharp](http://www.moonsharp.org/). 

The assembly name for our packaged MoonSharp dll has been renamed to `KerbaluaMoonSharp` for the reason explained [here](KerbaluaMoonSharp.md).

## Implementation
[Kerbalua/Scripting/KerbaluaScript](Kerbalua/Scripting/KerbaluaScript.md) is the class that implements the script engine itself.

Intellisense (Completion) is handled in [Kerbalua/Completion](Kerbalua/Completion/CompletionReadme.md).
