### Script Won't work
Make sure that if you are trying to execute Lua code, the Lua engine is selected. Click the "Lua" button to select that engine.
If you are trying to execute ROS code, ensure RedOnionScript engine is selected. Click the "RedOnion" button to select that engine.

The Repl/Editor both use whatever engine is currently selected. The currently selected engine will be shown in the textbox below the RedOnion and Lua buttons. The Repl also remembers which engine you used last.
