## Script Won't work:
Make sure that if you are trying to execute Lua code, the Lua engine is selected. Click the "Lua" button to select that engine.
If you are trying to execute ROS code, ensure RedOnionScript engine is selected. Click the "ROS" button to select that engine.

The Repl will use whatever engine is currently selected. The currently selected engine is shown by a label `Engine: EngineName` above the `ROS` and `Lua` buttons.

The editor will run the engine associated with a particular script name extension. If your script ends with ".lua" it will run the Lua engine, and if your script ends with ".ros" it will run the ros engine.

## How do I run a script?
Click the `Run` button when a script is in the editor, or enter some code into the repl input area.
